MiniJava-Compiler
=================

A compiler for [Minijava](http://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/MCIIJ2e/grammar.htm).

Parses minijava source files.  Reports syntax and semantic errors.  
Checks to ensure that variables are initialized before they are used.  
If the source code is error free, java bytecodes(class files) are generated in the current working directory. 
As a language addition, developers can user the power operator(**).

The generated byte code is backwards compatible with java 1.1 and will run on any version of java.
